# Babylon local deployment

This repository contains all the necessary artifacts and instructions to set up
and run a Babylon network locally, along with verifying proper functionalities.

## Components

The to-be-deployed Babylon network that features Babylon's BTC Staking and BTC
Timestamping protocols comprises the following components:

- 2 **Babylon Validator Nodes** running the base Tendermint consensus and producing
  Tendermint-confirmed Babylon blocks
- **BTC Validator** daemon: Hosts one or more BTC Validators which commit public
  randomness and submit finality signatures for Babylon blocks to Babylon
- **BTC Staker** daemon: Enables the staking of BTC tokens to PoS chains by
  locking BTC tokens on the BTC network and submitting a delegation to a
  dedicated BTC Validator; the daemon connects to a BTC wallet that manages
  multiple private/public keys and performs staking requests from BTC public
  keys to dedicated BTC Validators
- **BTC covenant emulation Jury** daemon: Pre-signs the BTC slashing
  transaction to enforce that malicious stakers' stake will be sent to a
  pre-defined burn BTC address in case they attack Babylon
- **Vigilante Monitor** daemon: Detects attacks to Babylon and submits slashing
  transactions to the BTC network for the BTC Validators and the associated
  stakers
- **Vigilante Submitter** daemon: Aggregates and checkpoints Babylon epochs (a
  group of `X` Babylon blocks) to the BTC network
- **Vigilante Reporter** daemon: Keeps track of the BTC network's state in
  Babylon and detects Babylon checkpoints that have received a BTC timestamp
  (i.e. have been confirmed in BTC)
- A **BTC simnet** acting as the BTC network, operated through a bitcoind / btcd
  node

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker Desktop

    All components are executed as Docker containers on the local machine, so a
    local Docker installation is required. Depending on your operating system,
    you can find relevant instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

2. Install `make`

    Required to build the service binaries. One tutorial that can be followed
    is [this](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/make-install.html).

3. Set up an SSH key to GitHub

    Create a **non passphrase-protected** SSH key and add it to GitHub according
    to the instructions
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

4. Clone the repository and initialize git submodules

    The aforementioned components are included in the repo as git submodules, so
    they need to be initialized accordingly.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:babylonchain/babylon-deployment.git
    git submodule init && git submodule update
    ```

## Deploying a local Babylon network

To start the network, the following command needs to be executed:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/path/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-btcstaking-bitcoind
```

In case the local deployment is ran on a **Linux** system, make sure to run this
as a superuser:

```shell
sudo make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/path/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-btcstaking-bitcoind
```

where `BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY` is a system path to the private SSH key that you
created and added to GitHub before. As mentioned, **this key must have no
passphrase - otherwise the network startup will fail.**

The following containers should be created as a result:

```shell
Creating bitcoindsim   ... done
Creating babylondnode0 ... done
Creating babylondnode1 ... done
Creating btc-jury            ... done
Creating btc-validator       ... done
Creating btc-staker          ... done
Creating vigilante-reporter  ... done
Creating vigilante-monitor   ... done
Creating vigilante-submitter ... done
```

### Deployment process description

The `make` command that was executed above will perform the following actions:

- Build Docker images for every component
- Create a genesis file that will be used to bootstrap the Babylon network
- Spin up all the aforementioned services as Docker containers. Every required
  Docker container is included in a
  [Docker Compose](btc-staking-bitcoind.docker-compose.yml) manifest, which is
  then applied to boot the services.
- Execute a [script](btcstaking-wrapper.sh) that showcases the complete
  lifecycle of Babylon's BTC Staking protocol. This will be further analyzed
  below.

Overall, the whole process can last around 15-20 minutes, depending on the
available computing resources and connection bandwidth.

## Inspecting and interacting with the BTC Staking Protocol

We will now analyze each step that is executed as part of the BTC
Staking showcasing script - more specifically, how it is performed and its
outcome for the Babylon and the BTC network respectively.

### Generating BTC Validators

Initially, 3 BTC Validators are created and registered on Babylon through the
BTC Validator daemon. For each Babylon block, the daemon will now check if
the Validators have simnet BTC tokens staked to them. The Validators that have
staked tokens can submit finality signatures.

Through the BTC Validator's daemon logs we can verify the above (only 1
Validator is included in all the example outputs in this section for
simplicity):

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-validator
...
time="2023-08-18T10:28:37Z" level=debug msg="handling CreateValidator request"

...
```

As these Validators don't have any BTC tokens staked to them, they cannot submit
finality signatures at this point:

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-validator
...
time="2023-08-18T10:28:44Z" level=debug msg="received a new block, the validator is going to vote" babylon_pk_hex=0386b928eedab5e1f6dc7e4334651cca9c1f039589ac6fd14ece12df8e091a07d0 block_height=5

...
```

The Validators are now periodically generating and submitting EOTS randomness to
Babylon:

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-validator
...
time="2023-08-18T10:28:44Z" level=info msg="successfully committed public randomness to Babylon" babylon_pk_hex=0386b928eedab5e1f6dc7e4334651cca9c1f039589ac6fd14ece12df8e091a07d0 btc_pk_hex=1083b0c28491e9660cd252afa9fd36431e93a86adf21801533f365de265de4ba last_committed_height=109 tx_hash=015216B602472E6F2BFBECEB40170D037AC4C3B1B795FC9CFB495A3A0416B3DB
...
```

#### Generating a new BTC Validator manually

To achieve this, we need to take a shell into the BTC Validator Docker container
and interact with the daemon through its CLI util, `valcli`.

```shell
# Take shell into the running BTC Validator daemon
$ docker exec -it btc-validator sh
# Create a BTC Validator named `my_validator`. This Validator holds a BTC
# public key (where the staked tokens will be sent to) and a Babylon account
# (where the Babylon reward tokens will be sent to). The public keys of both are
# visible from the command output.
~ valcli daemon create-validator --key-name my_validator
{
    "babylon_pk": "0251259b5c88d6ac79d86615220a8111ebb238047df0689357274f004fba3e5a89",
    "btc_pk": "f6eae95d0e30e790bead4e4359a0ea596f2179a10f96dcedd953f07331918ca7"
}
# Register the Validator with Babylon. Now, the Validator is ready to receive
# delegations. The output contains the hash of the validator registration
# Babylon transaction.
~ valcli daemon register-validator --key-name my_validator
{
    "tx_hash": "800AE5BBDADE974C5FA5BD44336C7F1A952FAB9F5F9B43F7D4850BA449319BAA"
}
# List all the BTC Validators managed by the BTC Validator daemon. 4 Validators
# should be listed; 3 created by the script, plus the one that was just created
# manually. The `status` field can receive the following values:
# - `1`: The Validator is active and has received no delegations yet
# - `2`: The Validator is active and has staked BTC tokens
# - `3`: The Validator is inactive (i.e. had staked BTC tokens in the past but
#   not anymore OR has been slashed)
~ valcli daemon list-validators
{
    "validators": [
        ...
        {
            "babylon_pk_hex": "0251259b5c88d6ac79d86615220a8111ebb238047df0689357274f004fba3e5a89",
            "btc_pk_hex": "f6eae95d0e30e790bead4e4359a0ea596f2179a10f96dcedd953f07331918ca7",
            "last_committed_height": 265,
            "status": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

### Staking BTC tokens

Next, one BTC staking request is sent to each BTC Validator through the BTC
Staker daemon. Each request originates from a different BTC public key, and
a 1-1 mapping between BTC public keys and BTC Validators is maintained.

Each request locks 1 million Satoshis from a simnet BTC address and stakes them
to the BTC Validator, for several simnet BTC blocks (specifically, 500 blocks
for the first 2 BTC public keys, and 10 blocks for the last BTC public key).

We can verify the BTC staking requests from the logs of the BTC Staker daemon;
for our example, we will include logs related to one of the staking requests.

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-staker
...

...
```

The following events are occurring here:
- The BTC Staker daemon creates a BTC staking transaction, signs it
  and submits it to the BTC simnet
- The BTC Staker is monitoring the BTC simnet until the staking transaction
  receives `X` confirmations (in our case, `X = 2`)
- The BTC Staker creates and pre-signs a BTC slashing transaction, which will
  be sent to the BTC simnet in case the BTC Validator attacks Babylon
- The BTC Staker submits this transaction to Babylon, so that BTC Jury can
  pre-sign it too

The delegation has now been created, but is not activated yet. The last step
is for BTC Jury to also pre-sign the slashing BTC transaction.

Through BTC Jury daemon logs, we can inspect this event:

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-jury
...
time="2023-08-18T10:29:42Z" level=info msg="successfully submit Jury sig over Bitcoin delegation to Babylon" delBtcPk=46748d01a2f00dfabf8be55031932c68dcea5636d47f9e2e3bdc29d36e8b440b txHash=959F16BA3A0D790E70CF486D48BFA3F8753E7A46EE2D79C97CF67D35711C7791 valBtcPubKey=1083b0c28491e9660cd252afa9fd36431e93a86adf21801533f365de265de4ba
...
```

The delegation is now active, and the BTC Validator that received it will be
eligible to submit finality signatures until the delegation expires (i.e. in 500
simnet BTC blocks). From BTC Validator daemon logs:

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-validator
...
time="2023-08-18T10:30:09Z" level=info msg="successfully submitted a finality signature to Babylon" babylon_pk_hex=0386b928eedab5e1f6dc7e4334651cca9c1f039589ac6fd14ece12df8e091a07d0 block_height=21 btc_pk_hex=1083b0c28491e9660cd252afa9fd36431e93a86adf21801533f365de265de4ba tx_hash=7BF8200BA71E640036141115AED2EE3D6E74682FDA72CD280722C0A2F06FE537
...
```

#### Staking BTC tokens manually

Continuing from the previous manual step reproduction, we had already created a
BTC Validator with BTC public key hex
`f6eae95d0e30e790bead4e4359a0ea596f2179a10f96dcedd953f07331918ca7` and Babylon
public key hex
`0251259b5c88d6ac79d86615220a8111ebb238047df0689357274f004fba3e5a89`.

Now, we will stake 1 million Satoshis to this Validator from a funded simnet
BTC address, for 100 Bitcoin blocks. To achieve this, we need to take shell into
the BTC Staker container and interact with the daemon through its CLI utility,
`stakercli`.

```shell
# Take shell into the running BTC Staker daemon
$ docker exec -it btc-staker sh
# Obtain a simnet BTC address from the bitcoind node that BTC Staker daemon is
# currently connected to
~ delegator_btc_addr=$(stakercli dn list-outputs | \
jq -r ".outputs[].address" | shuf -n 1)
# Submit a BTC staking transaction as specified above, using the Validator's
# BTC public key hex
~ stakercli daemon stake --staker-address $delegator_btc_addr \
--staking-amount 1000000 \
--validator-pk f6eae95d0e30e790bead4e4359a0ea596f2179a10f96dcedd953f07331918ca7 \
--staking-time 100
{
    "tx_hash": "35650a6b7d0294f457b6ba3eaed3f04d9c4f07de392729f7051720136e0586fa"
}
```

### Attacking Babylon and extracting BTC private key

Next, an attack to Babylon is initiated from one of the 3 BTC Validators.
As attack is defined as a BTC Validator submitting a finality signature for a
Babylon block at height X, while they have already submitted a finality
signature for a different (i.e. conflicting) Babylon block at the same height X.

When the BTC Validator attacks Babylon, its Bitcoin private key is extracted
and exposed. The corresponding output of the `make` command looks like the
following:

```shell
Attack Babylon by submitting a conflicting finality signature for a validator
{
    "tx_hash": "8F4951C848C59DF9C0EC95E42A3C690DDA8EF0B58DD10DF04038F8368BA8A098",
    "extracted_sk_hex": "1034f95e93f70904fcf59db6acfa8782d3803056ff786b732a73dc298b6ca77b",
    "local_sk_hex": "1034f95e93f70904fcf59db6acfa8782d3803056ff786b732a73dc298b6ca77b"
}
Validator with Bitcoin public key 0386b928eedab5e1f6dc7e4334651cca9c1f039589ac6fd14ece12df8e091a07d0 submitted a conflicting finality signature for Babylon height 23; the Validator's private BTC key has been extracted and the Validator will now be slashed
```

Now that the BTC Validator's private key has been exposed, the only remaining
step is activating the BTC slashing transaction. This transaction will
transfer all the BTC tokens staked to this Validator to a simnet BTC burn address
specified in Babylon's genesis file. The Vigilante Monitor daemon is responsible
for this, and through its logs we can inspect this event:

```shell
$ docker logs -f vigilante-monitor
...
time="2023-08-18T10:30:25Z" level=info msg="start slashing BTC validator 1083b0c28491e9660cd252afa9fd36431e93a86adf21801533f365de265de4ba" module=slasher

...
```

#### Attacking Babylon manually

Continuing from the previous manual step reproduction, we had already created a
BTC Validator with BTC public key hex
`f6eae95d0e30e790bead4e4359a0ea596f2179a10f96dcedd953f07331918ca7` and Babylon
public key hex
`0251259b5c88d6ac79d86615220a8111ebb238047df0689357274f004fba3e5a89`.

Now, we will submit a conflicting finality signature for this Validator, for the
latest Babylon height that they have submitted a finality signature. To achieve
this, we need to take shell into the BTC Validator container and interact with
the daemon through its CLI utility, `valcli`.

```shell
# Take shell into the running BTC Validator daemon
$ docker exec -it btc-validator sh
# Find the latest height for which the Validators have submitted finality
# signatures
~ attackHeight=$(valcli dn ls | jq -r ".validators[].last_voted_height" | sort -nr | head -n 1)
# Add a signature for a conflicting block using the Validator's Babylon public
# key; the command will by default vote for a predefined conflicting block
~ valcli dn add-finality-sig --height $attackHeight \
--babylon-pk 0251259b5c88d6ac79d86615220a8111ebb238047df0689357274f004fba3e5a89
{
    "tx_hash": "A7D69335C19C3E7F312A5C4BD71FBFC1DD27B863A13C8AD3CABBCCFDCA218461",
    "extracted_sk_hex": "1b50114c7b7a2982434abe8e4f0c9db578b5e847359aea98bad8212a67aef838",
    "local_sk_hex": "1b50114c7b7a2982434abe8e4f0c9db578b5e847359aea98bad8212a67aef838"
}
```

### Unbonding staked BTC tokens

The last BTC staking request that was placed by the BTC Staker daemon had a
simnet BTC token time-lock of 10 BTC blocks. This is done on purpose, so that
the staking period expires quickly and the unbonding of expired BTC staked
tokens can be demonstrated.

The final action of the showcasing script is to unbond these BTC tokens.
The BTC Staker daemon submits a simnet BTC transaction to this end - we can
verify this through its logs:

```shell
$ docker logs -f btc-staker

After the transaction is confirmed on BTC simnet, the unbonding of the BTC
tokens is complete.

#### Unbonding staked BTC tokens manually

On our previous manual step reproductions, we created a BTC Validator, staked
tokens to it and submitted a conflicting finality signature for it; this led to
its slashing. As a result, we cannot reuse this Validator now.

For this example, the steps from sections
[Generating a new BTC Validator manually](#generating-a-new-btc-validator-manually)
and
[Staking BTC tokens manually](#staking-btc-tokens-manually) should be
repeated. This time, the manual BTC staking request should last for **10 BTC
blocks** - so that it will expire quickly enough for us to unbond its tokens
(in up to 3 minutes, given that our simnet's BTC block creation rate is 10
seconds). After this amount of time has passed, we can now unbond the BTC
tokens from the expired delegation.

To unbond the tokens, we need to take shell into the same BTC Staker container
and interact with the daemon through its CLI utility, `stakercli`.

```shell
# Take shell into the running BTC Staker daemon
$ docker exec -it btc-staker sh
# Let's assume that the BTC staking transaction hash that was outputted by
# the `stakercli daemon stake` command is the following
$ btcStkTxHash=2303fa60324ac8d049de1c423073a3f577f64ae5a83b0b054820b2b01735cc09
# Submit a BTC unbonding transaction by re-using this same hash
~ stakercli daemon unstake --staking-transaction-hash $btcStkTxHash
{
    "tx_hash": "2303fa60324ac8d049de1c423073a3f577f64ae5a83b0b054820b2b01735cc09",
    "tx_value": "997500"
}
```
